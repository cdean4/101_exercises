Lesson 3 - Topic 3 - Easy 2
Question 1
In this hash of people and their age,
ages = { "Herman" => 32, "Lily" => 30, "Grandpa" => 402, "Eddie" => 10 }
see if "Spot" is present.
Bonus: What are two other hash methods that would work just as well for this solution?
Answer
ages.has_key?(“Spot”)

Two Alternatives
ages.include?("Spot")
ages.assoc(“Spot”)

Question 2
Starting with this string:
munsters_description = "The Munsters are creepy in a good way."

Convert the string in the following ways (code will be executed on original munsters_description above):
"The munsters are creepy in a good way."
"tHE mUNSTERS ARE CREEPY IN A GOOD WAY."
"the munsters are creepy in a good way."
"THE MUNSTERS ARE CREEPY IN A GOOD WAY."

Answer
	i.	munsters_description.capitalize
	ii.	munsters_description.swapcase
	iii.	munsters_description.downcase
	iv.	munsters_description.upcase

Question 3
We have most of the Munster family in our age hash:
ages = { "Herman" => 32, "Lily" => 30, "Grandpa" => 5843, "Eddie" => 10 }
add ages for Marilyn and Spot to the existing hash
additional_ages = { "Marilyn" => 22, "Spot" => 237 }

Answer
ages.merge(additional_ages)

Question 4
See if the name "Dino" appears in the string below:
advice = "Few things in life are as important as house training your pet dinosaur."

Answer
advice.include?“Dino”
or
advice.match(“Dino”)

Question 5
Show an easier way to write this array:
flintstones = ["Fred", "Barney", "Wilma", "Betty", "BamBam", "Pebbles"]

Answer
flintstones = %w(Fred Barney Wilma Betty BamBam)

Question 6
How can we add the family pet "Dino" to our usual array:
flintstones = %w(Fred Barney Wilma Betty BamBam Pebbles)

Answer
flintstones << ‘Dino’
flintstones.insert(5, ‘Dino’)

Question 7
In the previous practice problem we added Dino to our array like this:
flintstones = %w(Fred Barney Wilma Betty BamBam Pebbles)
flintstones << "Dino"
We could have used either Array#concat or Array#push to add Dino to the family.
How can we add multiple items to our array? (Dino and Hoppy)
Answer
flintstones.insert(5,’Dino’,’Hoppy’)
OR
flintstones.push(“Dino”).push(“Hoppy”)

Question 8
Shorten this sentence:
advice = "Few things in life are as important as house training your pet dinosaur."

...remove everything starting from "house".
Review the String#slice! documentation, and use that method to make the return value "Few things in life are as important as ". But leave the advice variable as "house training your pet dinosaur.".
Answer
advice.slice!(" house training your pet dinosaur.")
advice.slice!(0, advice.index('house'))
If Strning#slice is used then advice won’t be mutated.

Question 9
Write a one-liner to count the number of lower-case 't' characters in the following string:
statement = "The Flintstones Rock!"
Answer
statement.count(“t”)

Question 10
Back in the stone age (before CSS) we used spaces to align things on the screen. If we had a 40 character wide table of Flintstone family members, how could we easily center that title above the table with spaces?
title = "Flintstone Family Members"
Answer
title.count(“Flintstones Family Members”)
title.insert(0,’        ‘).insert(-1,’       ‘)
OR
title.center(40)
